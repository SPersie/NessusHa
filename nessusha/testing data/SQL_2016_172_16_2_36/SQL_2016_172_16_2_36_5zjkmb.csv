It is recommended that SQL Server software be installed on a dedicated server. This architectural consideration affords security flexibility in that the database server can be placed on a separate subnet allowing access only from particular hosts and over particular protocols. Degrees of availability are easier to achieve as well - over time, an enterprise can move from a single database server to a failover to a cluster using load balancing or to some combination thereof.

Rationale:
It is easier to manage (i.e. reduce) the attack surface of the server hosting SQL Server software if the only surfaces to consider are the underlying operating system, SQL Server itself, and any security/operational tooling that may additionally be installed. As noted in the description, availability can be more easily addressed if the database is on a dedicated server.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Solution : 

Uninstall excess tooling and/or remove unnecessary roles from the underlying operating system.

Impact:
It is difficult to see any reasonably adverse impact to making this architectural change, once the costs of making the change have been paid. Custom applications may need to be modified to accommodate database connections over the wire rather than on the host (i.e. using TCP/IP instead of Named Pipes). Additional hardware and operating system licenses may be required to make these architectural changes.

SQL Server supports Shared Memory, Named Pipes, and TCP/IP protocols. However, SQL Server should be configured to use the bare minimum required based on the organization's needs.

Rationale:
Using fewer protocols minimizes the attack surface of SQL Server and, in some cases, can protect it from remote attacks.

Solution : 

Open SQL Server Configuration Manager; go to the SQL Server Network Configuration. Ensure that only required protocols are enabled. Disable protocols not necessary.

Impact:
The Database Engine (MSSQL and SQLAgent) services must be stopped and restarted for the change to take effect.

Default Value:
By default, TCP/IP and Shared Memory protocols are enabled on all commercial editions.

The service account and/or service SID used by the MSSQLSERVER service for a default instance or MSSQL$<InstanceName> service for a named instance should not be a member of the Windows Administrator group either directly or indirectly (via a group). This also means that the account known as LocalSystem (aka NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) should not be used for the MSSQL service as this account has higher privileges than the SQL Server service requires.

Rationale:
Following the principle of least privilege, the service account should have no more privileges than required to do its job. For SQL Server services, the SQL Server Setup will assign the required permissions directly to the service SID. No additional permissions or privileges should be necessary.
