If enabled, the default SQL Server instance will be assigned a default port of TCP:1433 for TCP/IP communication. Administrators can also configure named instances to use TCP:1433 for communication. TCP:1433 is a widely known SQL Server port and this port assignment should be changed.

Non-clustered SQL Server instances within production environments should be designated as hidden to prevent advertisement by the SQL Server Browser service. Designating production SQL Server instances as hidden leads to a more secure installation because they cannot be enumerated. However, clustered instances may break if this option is selected

Solution : 

1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, expand SQL Server Network Configuration, right-click Protocols for <server instance>, and then select Properties.

2. On the Flags tab, in the Hide Instance box, select Yes, and then click OK to close the dialog box. The change takes effect immediately for new connections.

OR

Execute the following T-SQL to remediate:
EXEC master..xp_instance_regwrite
@rootkey = N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',
@key = N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQLServer\SuperSocketNetLib',
@value_name = N'HideInstance',
@type = N'REG_DWORD',
@value = 1;

Impact:
This method only prevents the instance from being listed on the network. If the instance is hidden (not exposed by SQL Browser), then connections will need to specify the server and port in order to connect. It does not prevent users from connecting to server if they know the instance name and port. If you hide a clustered named instance, the cluster service may not be able to connect to the SQL Server. Please refer to the Microsoft documentation reference.

The service account and/or service SID used by the MSSQLSERVER service for a default instance or MSSQL$<InstanceName> service for a named instance should not be a member of the Windows Administrator group either directly or indirectly (via a group). This also means that the account known as LocalSystem (aka NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) should not be used for the MSSQL service as this account has higher privileges than the SQL Server service requires.

Rationale:
Following the principle of least privilege, the service account should have no more privileges than required to do its job. For SQL Server services, the SQL Server Setup will assign the required permissions directly to the service SID. No additional permissions or privileges should be necessary.

Adjust the number of logs to prevent data loss. The default value of 6 may be insufficient for a production environment.
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Open Object Explorer and connect to the target instance.
3. Navigate to the Management tab in Object Explorer and expand. Right click on the SQL Server Logs file and select Configure
4. Check the Limit the number of error log files before they are recycled
